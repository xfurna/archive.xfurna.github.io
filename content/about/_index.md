Hi! I am **Archit**, currently a senior year undergraduate student at **IIT Jodhpur** in the department of **Bioscience and Bioengineering**. I am a highly dedicated and hard-working individual seeking an entry-level position to begin my career in a high-level professional environment. By definition, what I want to do in life is called entrepreneurship (as in, doing my own thing). But don't let the wordings fool you. *My goals are beyond your understanding*, so to speak.

I am a firm believer and practitioner of [the first principle of thinking](https://jamesclear.com/first-principles). I perceive the world in accordance with its function rather than its form. This mindset helps me to have a clear understanding of the things which, I believe, is a great step in the direction of the ideology of [learning for mastery](https://www.ted.com/talks/sal_khan_let_s_teach_for_mastery_not_test_scores?language=en).

On best days, you’ll catch me reading books, research papers, listening to podcasts, tweeting, pushing pixels or petting some or the other of my pet projects. I can also be found walking/cycling distances while in *estado-de-resonancia* with the melodies of **Led Zeppelin** and **Deep Purple** or the trip-hop numbers of **Lucian**. But most often, I listen to heavy/death metal by **S.O.A.D**, **Otep**, **As I Lay Dying** or even **Obituary** at times.

## Experience
I have more than one and a half years of experience working in the Computational Biology lab at IIT Jodhpur. I have worked on a range of projects there. While working on these projects I have explored various ML/DL algorithms and done statistical analyses of biological data. My research work has resulted in two publications (submitted after minor revision) in a reputed peer-reviewed journal and an international conference respectively.

My work includes the development of an integrative clustering method for multi-view omics data; demonstration of the effectiveness of the proposed method over other methods; and, establishing biological relevance for the obtained results.
Currently, I am working on Genome-Wide Association Studies which involves rigorous statistical analysis and deep learning. Although this project is still in its early stage yet I have gained a lot of experience in High-Performance Computing, statistical modelling and deep learning.

I have only a few projects worth of experience in AI/ML, but the flip side of my inexperience tends to be energy, enthusiasm, and a willingness to work and hustle in order to learn.

## Random Facts
- *Archit*, as I am, is an ancient word of *Sanskrit* origin (अर्चित) and form *'Arcita'* which literally means *worshipped/praised/respected*.
- It's *s.foor.nuh* and not *ex.foor.naa* or *ex.foor.nuh* or anything else.
- In my opinion, my whole life is a [bandit problem](https://joshkaufman.net/explore-exploit/).
- I hang out on twitter.
- I drink a lot of coffee.
- My hobby: Imagining people speaking in someone else's voice.
